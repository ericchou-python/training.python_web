Week05 Assignment

1. I went thru the Flask tutorial line by line to build muscle memory.
2. Results is what I checked in here. 
3. Then went thru class notes again to make sure I understood the steps. 
4. Spent a few hours troubleshooting the last section on how to make the flaskr program work on the VM.
    a. Think the problem lies with WSGI cannot access the Python standard library modules. 
    b. workaround is to include all the sys.path in /var/www/flaskr.wsgi

5. My VM URL:
http://block647043-lud.blueboxgrid.com/

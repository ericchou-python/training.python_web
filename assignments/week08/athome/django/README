*** Problem Statement ***

Create a Django site that prototypes inventory control:

1. Allow user to see a list of available manufactures
 - https://esmee.pythonicneteng.com/inventory/manufactures/
2. Allow users to see inventory count on each manufactures
 - example: https://esmee.pythonicneteng.com/inventory/manufactures/Manufacture_1/
3. Allow users to place orders and inventory is automatically updated (not done)
 - click on order
 - log in using sales1/sales1
 - redirect to https://esmee.pythonicneteng.com/orderPipeline/
 - select Manufacture
 - select product (decided to use hidden field in form instead of cookie)
 - need to complete teh pipeline
4. Needs user authentication
 - use default authentication 
 - see separate email for admin login for Instructors
5. Use HTML/CSS to make site presentation (re-learned Dreamweaver and Spray for menu)
